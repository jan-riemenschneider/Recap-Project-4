# Recap Project 4 - Color Cards App Creator

## Project Overview
The **Color Cards App Creator** is an application that allows users to create, manage, and display color cards dynamically using React. Each color card includes a color preview and its associated hex code. Users can add new color cards through a form, and the application supports the management of these cards with functionalities like copying the hex code, updating, or deleting cards.

## Description
The **Color Cards App Creator** is an interactive web application built with React, designed to help users easily create and manage a collection of color cards. Each card showcases a specific color along with its corresponding hex code. The app provides a simple interface for adding, editing, and deleting cards, with all data being stored in the browser's localStorage for persistence.

Users can also copy the hex code of any color to their clipboard with a single click, making it a useful tool for designers and developers who frequently work with color schemes. The app is deployed using Vercel, ensuring easy access and smooth performance across different devices.

This project was developed as part of the **neueFische Bootcamp**, aimed at enhancing my understanding of React's state management, form handling, and localStorage. It serves as a demonstration of how to build a fully functional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application in React with basic styling using CSS.

## Features
- **Create Color Cards:** Users can add new color cards displaying a color and its hex code.
- **View Color Cards:** All added color cards are displayed in a clean gallery layout.
- **Update and Delete Cards:** Users can edit or delete existing cards as needed.
- **Copy Hex Code:** A "Copy to Clipboard" button allows users to easily copy the hex code of any color.
- **Persistent Storage:** Color cards are saved in localStorage and remain available after page reloads.
